## a simple wifi tool

The `UltimateWiFiTool` provided in the code is a comprehensive Wi-Fi analysis, penetration, and management tool written in Go. It offers a variety of features for scanning, cracking, jamming, and analyzing wireless networks. Below, I’ll explain its features, capabilities, and how to use it in English.

### **Features and Capabilities**

1. **Wi-Fi Network Scanning**:
   - Detects nearby Wi-Fi networks and collects details such as SSID, BSSID, channel, signal strength (RSSI), and encryption type.
   - Uses the `gopacket` library for packet capturing and analysis.

2. **Monitor Mode Activation**:
   - Switches the network interface to monitor mode to capture Wi-Fi packets passively.

3. **WPA/WPA2 Brute-Force Attack**:
   - Attempts to crack WPA/WPA2 passwords using a provided wordlist.
   - Employs the PBKDF2 algorithm to derive keys (simplified in this demo; a real implementation would require a captured handshake).

4. **Network Jamming**:
   - Disrupts connections between clients and access points by sending deauthentication packets.
   - The number of jamming threads can be controlled with the `JamPower` parameter.

5. **Fake Access Point Creation**:
   - Creates a rogue AP with a custom SSID (e.g., mimicking a target network) to trick users into connecting.

6. **WPS Cracking**:
   - Attempts to crack WPS pins by brute-forcing possible combinations (simulated in this code).

7. **Signal Analysis**:
   - Analyzes the signal strength of detected networks and provides suggestions (e.g., move closer or reduce interference if the signal is weak).

8. **Packet Injection**:
   - Placeholder functionality for injecting custom packets (e.g., ARP or fake beacons), though not fully implemented in this code.

9. **Multi-threaded Processing**:
   - Uses goroutines with a configurable maximum limit (`MaxGoroutines`) for parallel operations like brute-forcing.

10. **Result Saving**:
    - Saves scan results, cracked passwords, and statistics to a JSON file specified by the `OutputFile` parameter.

11. **Verbose Logging**:
    - Provides detailed output during execution if the `Verbose` flag is enabled.

12. **GPS Support**:
    - Includes a placeholder for GPS mapping (not implemented in this version).

13. **Statistics Tracking**:
    - Tracks metrics like packets captured, networks found, crack attempts, and jamming packets sent.

### **How to Use the Tool**

#### **Prerequisites**
- **Operating System**: Linux (due to reliance on tools like `iwconfig`, `aireplay-ng`, and `hostapd`).
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Install Go (`golang`) and required libraries:
    ```bash
    go get github.com/google/gopacket
    go get golang.org/x/crypto/pbkdf2
    ```
  - Install external tools: `iwconfig`, `aireplay-ng` (part of `aircrack-ng`), and `hostapd`.
- **Hardware**: A Wi-Fi adapter capable of monitor mode and packet injection (e.g., one with an Atheros or Ralink chipset).
- **Permissions**: Run the tool with `sudo` since it requires root privileges to manipulate network interfaces and capture packets.

#### **Compilation**
1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `ultimate_wifi_tool.go`.
2. Compile it:
   ```bash
   go build ultimate_wifi_tool.go
   ```

#### **Running the Tool**
The tool uses command-line flags to configure its behavior. Here’s the general syntax:
```bash
sudo ./ultimate_wifi_tool [flags]
```

#### **Available Flags**
- `-interface`: Network interface to use (default: `wlan0`).
  - Example: `-interface wlan1`
- `-wordlist`: Path to a wordlist file for WPA cracking.
  - Example: `-wordlist /path/to/wordlist.txt`
- `-channel`: Specific channel to scan (0 for all channels, default: 0).
  - Example: `-channel 6`
- `-timeout`: Duration of the scanning phase (default: 30s).
  - Example: `-timeout 1m`
- `-verbose`: Enable detailed logging (default: false).
  - Example: `-verbose`
- `-jam-power`: Number of jamming threads (default: 1).
  - Example: `-jam-power 3`
- `-gps`: Enable GPS mapping (not implemented, default: false).
  - Example: `-gps`
- `-output`: Output file for results (default: `wifi_results.json`).
  - Example: `-output results.json`
- `-goroutines`: Maximum number of concurrent goroutines (default: number of CPU cores).
  - Example: `-goroutines 4`

#### **Example Commands**
1. **Basic Scan**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./ultimate_wifi_tool -interface wlan0 -verbose
   ```
   - Scans all channels for 30 seconds and logs details.

2. **Scan and Crack WPA**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./ultimate_wifi_tool -interface wlan0 -wordlist rockyou.txt -timeout 1m
   ```
   - Scans for 1 minute and attempts to crack WPA networks using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

3. **Scan and Jam**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./ultimate_wifi_tool -interface wlan0 -jam-power 2 -verbose
   ```
   - Scans and jams detected networks with 2 concurrent jamming threads.

4. **Full Attack**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./ultimate_wifi_tool -interface wlan0 -wordlist passwords.txt -jam-power 3 -output results.json -goroutines 8
   ```
   - Scans, cracks WPA, jams networks, and saves results to `results.json` with 8 concurrent goroutines.

#### **Output**
- During execution, logs will display detected networks, cracking attempts, jamming status, etc., if `-verbose` is enabled.
- Results are saved to the specified output file in JSON format, including:
  - Detected networks (`Networks`).
  - Cracked passwords (`Cracked`).
  - Statistics (`Stats`).

### **Notes**
- **Legal Warning**: Using this tool to attack networks without permission is illegal in most jurisdictions. Use it only for educational purposes or on networks you own/have consent to test.
- **Limitations**: Some features (e.g., WPS cracking, packet injection) are placeholders and require additional implementation for real-world use.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure external tools (`aireplay-ng`, `hostapd`) are installed and compatible with your system.
